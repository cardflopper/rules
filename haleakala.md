# Heleakala Rules Summary
Overview: play numbered tiles to sections of the board, move shamans to collect cards which allow you to take actions such as build statues, collect items and avoid lava from the volcano.
## setup
  + put the boat where the pier is, each pawn goes in a different villages on the beach
  + separate the deck by back: 1/2/3 palm trees in different decks
  + deal out cards from the 1 palm tree deck around the board 
  + players take all the colored discs (see lava disc) and statues, set the small lava discs aside

## 4 possible actions on a turn
  
1. play a numbered disc to a beach space, move your shaman twice (uphill allowed only once)
1. return a numbered disc to your supply, move your shaman twice (uphill allowed only once)
1. play a numbered disc to a beach space where the boat is, then move the boat (clockwise) spaces equal to the disc's number, then distribute cards
1. move the boat one space clockwise (only if all your numbered discs are placed), then distribute cards

## distribute cards
+ cards are distributed when the boat moves to a new space
+ whoever has the higher total on the discs gets first pick, perform any actions from the card, then the lower player does the same.
+ if a player doesn't have a disc, they get no card

## card actions
| Card | Effect |
|-|-|
| Build | put a statue of your color where your shaman is|
| Shell | immediately spend to buy scoring card, or keep for future buy|
| Pearls | keep for points during scoring rounds, if you have both black and white, it's work more points combined|
| Nautilus (spiral) | keep for points during scoring rounds|
| Priestess | move lava disc one space counter/clock-wise|

## Buy scoring cards with shells

You can purchase scoring cards at these times
1. during a scoring round just before doing scoring
2. when you obtain a shell card

you pay the required shells (1 or 2) and take the scoring card of your choice.

## Scoring Rounds
1. Just before counting points begins
   *  lava comes down the hill possibly destroying some statues
   *  starting with the first player, players can spend shells to purchase scoring cards
2. score statues, cards (most fish, pearls, nautilus) and purchased scoring cards
3. return scoring cards to be purchased again

## Game End
+ The game ends when the 3 palm tree deck is empty and the boat moves to an empty space
+ One final scoring round is done
+ Additionally unspent shells cards are worth 1 point each
